Hey IH 👋

I'm a solo developer who just shipped 40 HTML5 browser games. All free, all playable at [eastsea.monster/games](https://eastsea.monster/games/). I want to share where I am, where I'm going, and how I'm thinking about turning this into a sustainable side business.

## What I Built

40 casual browser games. Puzzle, action, idle, rhythm, strategy — the whole spectrum. Every game is:
- A single self-contained HTML file (vanilla JS + Canvas API)
- Zero frameworks, zero dependencies
- Works on mobile and desktop
- PWA-ready (installable, works offline)
- Integrated with Telegram Mini App SDK

**Tech stack:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. That's it. No React, no Phaser, no game engine. Each game is 15-65KB.

## Why Browser Games?

I looked at the numbers and the opportunity is underrated:

- **3.2 billion** people play games on their phones
- **Browser games** have zero friction — no app store, no download, no install
- The old Flash game ecosystem (Miniclip, Newgrounds, Kongregate) died, but the demand didn't
- **Telegram Mini Apps** are a new distribution channel with 900M+ users and growing
- PWA + HTML5 means one codebase works everywhere

The gap: most browser games today are either (a) low-quality ad-farm garbage, or (b) require heavy frameworks and don't load on slow connections. There's room for fast, clean, ad-free games that just work.

## How AI Changed the Math

Here's the thing that makes this viable as a solo dev: AI assistance.

Building 40 polished games would've taken me a year working alone the traditional way. With AI handling the boilerplate, math, and scaffolding, I can focus on game design and polish — the parts that actually matter for player retention.

I'm NOT saying "AI made the games." AI helped me build the structure faster so I could spend more time on what makes games fun. There's a big difference.

## The Revenue Plan

Right now: **$0/mo**. Everything is free. That's intentional.

**Phase 1 — Distribution & Audience (Now)**
- Build the game library (40 done, targeting 100)
- Distribute across: web (SEO), Telegram Mini App, PWA installs
- Build organic traffic through communities and word of mouth
- Telegram bot: [@eastsea_games_bot](https://t.me/eastsea_games_bot)

**Phase 2 — Monetization (Next)**
- Telegram Stars (in-app purchases within Telegram Mini Apps)
- Optional cosmetic unlocks (skins, themes) — not pay-to-win
- Premium game pack (free tier + paid tier with extra content)
- Sponsorships / branded games for companies

**Phase 3 — Scale**
- Localization (games already support i18n infrastructure)
- Leaderboards + social features to boost retention
- Community-driven game requests
- Licensing the game library to portals / platforms

**Target:** Sustainable side income. I'm not trying to build the next Zynga. If this generates enough to cover my living expenses while I keep building games I enjoy, that's the win.

## The Numbers So Far

- **40 games** shipped
- **0 frameworks** used
- **1 developer** (me)
- **$0 spent** on infrastructure (GitHub Pages hosting)
- **0 ads** anywhere

It's early. But the library is real, the tech works, and the distribution channels are set up.

## What I'd Love Feedback On

1. Does the "free browser games → Telegram Mini App monetization" path make sense?
2. What's your experience with Telegram Stars / Mini App revenue?
3. Any browser game portals or distribution channels I'm missing?
