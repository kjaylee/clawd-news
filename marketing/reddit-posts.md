**Title:** 40 Free Browser Games — No Download, No Ads, Just Play

**URL:** https://eastsea.monster/games/

**Comment (post as OP immediately after):**

Hey r/WebGames! I've been building HTML5 browser games and just hit 40. All free, no ads, no login, no install — just click and play.

Some highlights:
- **Crystal Match** — match-3 puzzle with chain combos
- **Neon Snake** — classic snake with a synthwave twist
- **Mahjong Zen** — relaxing tile-matching
- **Power 2048** — the 2048 you know with power-ups
- **Zombie Survivor** — top-down survival action
- **Pipe Connect** — logic puzzle
- **Rhythm Pulse** — tap to the beat

They all run in your browser (mobile + desktop). Each game is a single HTML file — no frameworks, no build step, just vanilla JS and Canvas.

Would love to hear which ones you enjoy and what I should build next. Happy to answer any questions about the tech.

## 2. r/IndieGaming — Story Post

**Title:** I built 40 HTML5 games as a solo dev — here's what I learned

**Body:**

About a month ago I set myself a challenge: build as many complete, polished browser games as I could, working solo.

I just hit 40.

Every game is a single HTML file. No React. No Phaser. No Unity. Just vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and the HTML5 Canvas API. Each one runs in any modern browser — phone, tablet, desktop. No download, no install.

**The games span a bunch of genres:**
- Puzzle: Crystal Match, Mahjong Zen, Slide Block Match, Pipe Connect
- Action: Neon Snake, Zombie Survivor, Brick Breaker, Dungeon Run
- Strategy: Merge Tower, Stack Kingdom, Pixel Defense
- Idle/Casual: Fishing Tycoon, Pet Simulator, Idle Slime Merge
- Rhythm: Rhythm Pulse, Rhythm Runner

**What I learned:**
1. Constraints breed creativity. Single-file HTML forces you to be economical.
2. Vanilla JS is enough. Canvas API handles 2D games beautifully without any framework overhead.
3. Finishing games is the hard part. Starting is easy — polish and shipping takes 3x the effort.
4. AI tools helped a lot with the tedious parts (boilerplate, math functions, sprite generation), but game design still needs a human brain.

They're all free at **https://eastsea.monster/games/** — no ads, no accounts, just games.

If you're curious about the tech or the process, happy to go deep. And if you play any — genuinely would love feedback on which ones click and which ones don't.

## 3. r/gamedev — Development Process Post

**Title:** How I shipped 40 browser games as a solo dev with AI assistance — my process

**Body:**

I just finished building 40 HTML5 games — all vanilla JS, single-file, no frameworks. Wanted to share my process since a lot of people ask about AI-assisted game development.

**The Stack:**
- Pure HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript
- Canvas API for rendering
- Single HTML file per game (self-contained)
- No build tools, no npm, no bundler
- PWA-ready (works offline after first load)
- Telegram Mini App SDK integrated

**How AI Helped (and Didn't):**

AI was great for:
- Scaffolding game structures (game loop, state management, input handling)
- Math-heavy stuff (collision detection, physics calculations, pathfinding)
- Generating CSS animations and visual effects
- Boilerplate (touch events, responsive scaling, audio context setup)

AI was NOT great for:
- Game feel — the "juice" that makes a game satisfying still needs manual tuning
- Difficulty curves — AI tends to make games either trivially easy or impossibly hard
- Creative direction — "make a fun puzzle game" produces generic results; you need specific design intent
- Edge cases — weird browser quirks, mobile-specific issues, performance on low-end devices

**My Workflow:**
1. Design the core mechanic on paper (5-10 min sketch)
2. Use AI to scaffold the basic structure
3. Manually iterate on game feel, pacing, difficulty
4. Playtest on multiple devices (especially mobile)
5. Polish: add particles, screen shake, sound cues
6. Ship it

**File Sizes:**
Most games are 15-65KB for the entire HTML file. No external dependencies. They load instantly.

**Lessons for other devs:**
- Single-file architecture forces discipline. You can't hide complexity behind `node_modules/`.
- Canvas API is underrated. For 2D games, you don't need Phaser or Pixi.
- Shipping > perfecting. A finished simple game beats an unfinished ambitious one.
- AI accelerates the boring parts so you can focus on what makes games fun.

All 40 are free to play: **https://eastsea.monster/games/**

Happy to answer questions about any specific game's implementation, the AI workflow, or the tech decisions.

## 4. r/playmygame — Game Highlights Post

**Title:** 40 free browser games — here are 3 I'm most proud of [Web/Mobile]

**Body:**

I've been building HTML5 browser games solo and just hit 40 total. All free, no ads, no download — just open and play. Here are the 3 I'm most proud of:

---

🔮 **Crystal Match Quest**
https://eastsea.monster/games/crystal-match/

A match-3 puzzle game with chain combos and special gems. Swipe to match crystals, trigger cascading chain reactions, and try to beat your high score. If you like Bejeweled or Candy Crush-style games but want something clean and ad-free, give this a shot.

---

🐍 **Neon Snake**
https://eastsea.monster/games/neon-snake/

Classic snake reimagined with glowing neon visuals and a synthwave aesthetic. Simple controls, increasingly fast pacing. It's the snake game you played on your old Nokia, but prettier.

---

🀄 **Mahjong Zen**
https://eastsea.monster/games/mahjong-zen/

A calm, relaxing tile-matching game. Match pairs of tiles to clear the board. No time pressure, just zen. Great for unwinding.

---

All three work on mobile and desktop — just tap/click to play. They're single HTML files with zero frameworks, so they load instantly.

The full collection (40 games): **https://eastsea.monster/games/**

Genres include puzzle, action, idle, rhythm, strategy, and more. Would love to know which ones you enjoy and what you'd want to see next!
