## First Comment (Maker's Note)

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Jay, an indie developer from Korea.

Over the past few months, I've been building small HTML5 games as a creative outlet. What started as weekend projects grew into this collection of 38+ games.

**My goals:**
1. Create games that are fun in short bursts
2. No dark patterns or manipulative mechanics
3. Works everywhere - even on old phones

**Technical notes:**
- Built with vanilla JS, HTML5 Canvas, and Phaser.js
- Each game is under 50KB (most under 20KB)
- No external dependencies or analytics

**What's next:**
- More games (aiming for 50+ by Q1)
- Developer bundle with source code on Gumroad
- Mobile apps (Capacitor wrapper ready)

Would love your feedback on which genres you'd like to see more of!
