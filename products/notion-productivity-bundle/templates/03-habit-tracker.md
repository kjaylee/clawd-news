## 💡 Habit Building Tips

### The 2-Minute Rule
> If a habit takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. For bigger habits, scale them down to a 2-minute version to start.

### Stack Your Habits
> Attach new habits to existing ones. "After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

### Environment Design
> Make good habits obvious and easy. Make bad habits invisible and difficult.

### Don't Break the Chain
> Focus on consistency, not perfection. A small action is better than no action.
